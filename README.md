# DREAM-NetworkBridge
A C++ simulation of a network bridge implementing the Store-and-Forward algorithm. DREAM (Dynamic Relay for Ethernet and Ageing Management) dynamically learns MAC addresses, forwards Ethernet frames, and maintains a clean MAC table by removing outdated entries. A compact but insightful demonstration of how real network bridges operate.
